My Build Plan ðŸŽ¯
Phase 1: Core Architecture (Build First)
I'll create a modular, clean structure:
project/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html # Main canvas page
â”œâ”€â”€ css/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ main.css # Layout & styling
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ shapes.css # Shape styles
â”œâ”€â”€ js/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ canvas.js # Canvas management (pan, zoom)
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ shapes.js # Shape library & rendering
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ toolbar.js # Left sidebar (shape palette)
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ properties.js # Right sidebar (formatting)
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ state.js # Application state management (undo/redo)
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ utils.js # Shared helper functions
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ export.js # PowerPoint export logic
â””â”€â”€ lib/
â””â”€â”€ pptxgen.min.js # PowerPoint generation
Phase 2: Feature Implementation Order
Step 1: Canvas Foundation (30 mins)

Infinite canvas with pan/zoom (like Figma)
Grid background (optional toggle)
Use Fabric.js for canvas manipulation
Mouse/touch controls for navigation

Step 2: Left Sidebar - Shape Palette (30 mins)

Draggable shapes library:

Rectangles, circles, diamonds, cylinders
Arrows/connectors
Text boxes

Drag-and-drop onto canvas
Shape preview thumbnails

Step 3: Shape Manipulation (30 mins)

Click to select shapes
Drag to move
Resize handles (8-point)
Rotation handle
Delete with keyboard/button
Multi-select (Shift+Click or drag-select)

Step 4: Right Sidebar - Properties Panel (40 mins)

Fill: Color picker
Border: Color, width, style (solid/dashed)
Text: Font, size, color, alignment
Position: X, Y coordinates
Size: Width, height
Layer: Bring forward/send backward
Alignment tools: Align left/center/right, distribute evenly

Step 5: Connectors/Arrows (35 mins)

Click two shapes to connect
Smart anchoring to shape edges
Arrow styles (straight, curved, elbowed)
Maintain connections when shapes move

Step 6: Export to PowerPoint (30 mins)

Use PptxGenJS library
Convert canvas objects to PowerPoint shapes:

Rectangles â†’ slide.addShape('rect')
Circles â†’ slide.addShape('ellipse')
Text â†’ slide.addText()
Arrows â†’ slide.addShape('line') with arrowheads

Download as .pptx file
Each shape maintains position, size, colors, text
Error handling for failed exports

Step 7: Save/Load Projects (15 mins)

Save as JSON to localStorage or download
Load previous designs
Auto-save feature

Step 8: Undo/Redo & Keyboard Shortcuts (25 mins)

Undo/Redo stack implementation (Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Y)
Keyboard shortcuts:

Copy/Paste (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V)
Delete (Delete key)
Select All (Ctrl+A)
Duplicate (Ctrl+D)

Snap-to-grid toggle (hold Shift to disable)

Tech Stack Decision
I'll use:

Fabric.js - Best for canvas manipulation, has great shape handling
PptxGenJS - Proven PowerPoint export library
Vanilla JavaScript - Keep it lightweight for GitHub Pages
CSS Grid/Flexbox - For layout

Why This Approach?
âœ… No backend needed - Pure client-side
âœ… GitHub Pages compatible - Just static files
âœ… Fast loading - Minimal dependencies
âœ… Extensible - Easy to add features later
âœ… PowerPoint export proven - PptxGenJS is battle-tested
Expected Timeline
Total: ~4-5 hours for a polished MVP (with testing and debugging)
Core features (Steps 1-3): ~1.5 hours
Advanced features (Steps 4-8): ~2.5-3.5 hours

Implementation Priority
Phase A (Core MVP): Steps 1-3, 6-7 â†’ Get basic shapes and export working
Phase B (Polish): Steps 4-5, 8 â†’ Add properties panel, connectors, and UX improvements

Should I begin with Step 1 (canvas foundation)?
